ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Classification Project
This project showcases a complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline for classifying iris flowers into three distinct species â€” Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. It leverages the famous Iris dataset and applies several machine learning techniques to explore, visualize, and model the data for accurate classification.

ðŸ“Š Dataset
The Iris dataset contains 150 samples with the following features:

Sepal Length (cm)

Sepal Width (cm)

Petal Length (cm)

Petal Width (cm)

Species (target)

ðŸš€ Features
âœ… Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

âœ… Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using plots and pairwise feature relationships

âœ… Label encoding and feature scaling

âœ… Model building using various ML algorithms

âœ… Performance evaluation with accuracy scores and confusion matrix

âœ… Visualization of decision boundaries

âœ… Clean, commented, and reusable code structure

ðŸ§  Algorithms Implemented
Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

All models were evaluated using performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

ðŸ“¦ Tech Stack
Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas & NumPy â€“ Data manipulation and analysis

Matplotlib & Seaborn â€“ Data visualization

Scikit-learn â€“ Machine learning algorithms and evaluation

ðŸ“Œ Conclusion
This project serves as a great introduction to machine learning and classification tasks. It demonstrates not only how to build and train models but also how to visualize, compare, and interpret the results effectively. The included video adds a visual explanation of each step in the pipeline.
